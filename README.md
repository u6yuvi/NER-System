# NER-System
Build NER System from Scratch 

## Model Development
### Available Frameworks
1. Spacy
2. Flair
3. HuggingFace Transformer

### Steps
1. Data Processing and Understanding

Our objective will be to take one of the NER dataset and do preprocessing to create NER training labels in BIO scheme and understand the nature of the text by doing some basic data analysis.

2. Data Clustering 
3. Model Training 
4. Model Evaluation

## Model Optimisation


## Building Model Inference Endpoint.

## Model Deployment using KServe
